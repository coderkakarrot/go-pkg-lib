# Metric Example

This example tries to show how to implement the metrics package with package defined metrics and by registering new metrics yourself.

To run the application simply run following command:

```
go run main.go
```

OR using `docker-compose`:

```
docker-compose up
```

Docker provides prometheus container as well where metrics can be tested.
